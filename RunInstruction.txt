Improtant Note:
	CRD source code is tested only on Ubuntu system. Hence it is recommened to run this programe on the specified OS.

Installation instrution
1) Download and install recent anaconda distribution
2) In the current directory, you will find YAML file 'environment.yml'. This file contain all the necessary package that are needed to run CRD without any error
3) Run 'conda env create -f environment.yml'. This create a conda environment to run CRD

4) To Activate SiteDesign, just run 'conda activate SiteDesign'. Thats is it, you are good to go

CRD contains lots of python classes that are called at the appropriate steps. However, to simply the execution, we have provided 3 wrapper python scripts, that needs to be executed sequentially,

STEP-1) python PocketDesignInitiator.py <arg-1> <arg-2> <arg-3>  
arg-1 --> queryLigand.pdb (eg, ATP.pdb)
arg-2 --> No.of.Cores to utilize (eg, 4).
arg-3 --> New Folder Name to store all the results (eg, ATPOutput)


STEP-2) python MinMax.py <arg-1>
arg-1 --> queryLigand.pdb (eg, ATP.pdb)
Please note down the range

STEP-3) python PocketDesignGenerator.py <arg-1> <arg-2> <arg-3> <arg-4> <arg-5>     
arg-1 --> queryLigand.pdb (eg, ATP.pdb)
arg-2 --> No.of.Cores to utilize (eg, 4). We recommed to give a core count greater than 4, so that the entire process will run in parallel.
arg-3 --> New Folder Name to store all the results (eg, ATPOutput)
arg-4 --> Min number from MinMax.py
arg-5 --> Max number from MinMax.py


After all steps are executed, go to the directory ('ATPOutput') and look into the folder 'site'
Folder:site will contain 750 coordinates generated for your query ligand
